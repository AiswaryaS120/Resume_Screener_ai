## Project Description

This project is an AI-powered Resume Screener developed as part of the IBM SkillsBuild program. It automates the process of analyzing and ranking resumes against a job description using NLP techniques.

The system extracts text from resumes, compares with the job requirements, identifies missing skills, and calculates a combined score for ranking candidates. Results are displayed in a clear table with visualization.
